  whoIAm:
    "I am Brazilian and I have been living in Manchester since 2019. I have four years of experience Developing Applications, Continuous Improvement and Process Analysis. I've worked with VB, C#, .Net, SQL, Power Platform and Power BI, RPA(Automation Anywhere, Uipath), Sharepoint, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. I also have experience with Agile methodologies(Scrum) and Six Sigma, Lean, 5S, Problem Solving. What I like most about my work is working with problem solving, architecture and creating solutions that will facilitate the end user's daily life.",

  careerStory:
    "I started my career with IT in 2016, at Cargill working with application development in VB and VBA using MS Access as database for a small accounting team and my role there was to understand the process that the team did, design the solutions, develop the applications and test them. After 6 months the team's management became interested in the work I was doing and expanded it so that I could start meeting other supervisor within the same accounting tower. That's when I saw the need to start working with more robust databases like Microsoft SQL and more robust programing language like C#. As I worked in a Shared Services Center that was expanding, the continuous improvement team was also growing and was asking for a list of my projects, so in 2017 I was promoted to Perfomance Analyst and started doing projects for all of Cargill in Brazil.  That same year, Cargill start working with robots and the Shared Services Center in Brazil was chosen to be the pilot. One of my projects done in VBA was chosen for this type of automation and I was one of the developers chosen to start working with RPA and I develop different types of bots across Cargill.  In March 2019, I was invited to participate in a selection process for a project to implement RPA at Algar Tech, a large South American technology company and saw a good opportunity for growth. Where we were responsible for creating the company's first robots and defining tools and best practices",
